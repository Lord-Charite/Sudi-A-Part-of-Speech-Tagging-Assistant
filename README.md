# Sudi-A-Part-of-Speech-Tagging-Assistant
POS tagging is crucial in understanding and processing natural language. It involves assigning words with tags like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., based on their context in a sentence. This functionality forms a core part of digital assistants and is vital for interpreting and responding to user input.


This project implements a part-of-speech (POS) tagger, which labels each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. The project utilizes a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach to analyze and tag sentences efficiently.


Features

- POS Tagging: Automatically tags each word in a sentence with its part of speech.
- HMM-Based Analysis: Uses a hidden Markov model for efficient tagging.
- Flexible Input Handling: Can process individual sentences or entire text files.
- Customizable Models: Ability to train the model with different datasets.
- Accuracy Assessment: Test and evaluate the tagging accuracy.

Implementation Details

- HMM Approach: Explains the hidden Markov model used for tagging.
- Training and Testing: Training the model with datasets and testing/evaluating its accuracy.
- Viterbi Algorithm: Details on the implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for sequence prediction in POS tagging.
