# Sudi-A-Part-of-Speech-Tagging-Assistant
POS tagging is crucial in understanding and processing natural language. It involves assigning words with tags like nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc., based on their context in a sentence. This functionality forms a core part of digital assistants and is vital for interpreting and responding to user input.
Introduction

"Sudi" is a digital assistant project aimed at addressing the speech understanding challenges in natural language processing. This tool implements a part-of-speech (POS) tagger, which labels each word in a sentence with its corresponding part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. The project utilizes a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach to analyze and tag sentences efficiently.


Features

- POS Tagging: Automatically tags each word in a sentence with its part of speech.
- HMM-Based Analysis: Uses a hidden Markov model for efficient tagging.
- Flexible Input Handling: Can process individual sentences or entire text files.
- Customizable Models: Ability to train the model with different datasets.
- Accuracy Assessment: Includes tools to test and evaluate the tagging accuracy.

Implementation Details

- HMM Approach: Explains the hidden Markov model used for tagging.
- Training and Testing: Describes the process of training the model with datasets and testing its accuracy.
- Viterbi Algorithm: Details on the implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for sequence prediction in POS tagging.

Training and Testing the Model

Training the Model

- Prepare the Dataset: Format your training data with sentences and corresponding POS tags in separate files, like train_sentences.txt and train_tags.txt.
- Run Train Model
- Model Generation: The trained model with probabilities for POS transitions and observations will be generated.
- Save the Model: Save the trained model for future use to avoid retraining.

Testing the Model

- Prepare Test Data: Similar to training data, but with unseen sentences to ensure unbiased evaluation.
- Run the Test
- Evaluate Accuracy: The output will typically include the accuracy percentage, based on the number of correctly tagged words.

Interpret Results: High accuracy suggests effective tagging, while lower accuracy might indicate the need for more diverse training data or model adjustments.
